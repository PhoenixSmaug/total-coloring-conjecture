# Verification of the Total Coloring Conjecture for small graphs

One of the most famous open problem in Graph Theory is the Total Coloring Conjecture. For a total coloring we color all vertices and edges of a graph, such that no adjacent vertices, no adjacent edges and no edge and one of its endpoints have the same color. The conjecture claims that any graph $G$ has a total coloring using $\Delta(G) + 2$ differen colors, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of a vertex in $G$. Despite being more than 60 years old, it has only been proven in some restricted cases, like [in this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/0012-365X(95)00286-6) for graphs with $\Delta(G) \leq 5$.
